# Statistical-Modelling-Techniques


Computational Statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the use of computers to perform statistical analysis. It involves using algorithms, numerical methods and computational tools to solve complex statistical problems. Python is a popular programming language for computational statistics because of its simplicity, versatility, and a large community of data scientists.


Some common computational statistical techniques that can be implemented in Python include:

Monte Carlo simulation: Used to generate random numbers and simulate complex processes.

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): A family of algorithms used to sample from complex probability distributions.

Optimization: Used to find the maximum or minimum value of a function.

Numerical Integration: Used to calculate the definite integral of a function.

Bootstrapping: A resampling method used to estimate the distribution of an estimator.

Dimensionality reduction: Used to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while preserving the essential information.

Python has several libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and PyMC3 that provide efficient implementation of these techniques. Additionally, there are several libraries that provide visualization tools to help in the analysis of the results.

In conclusion, Python is a powerful tool for computational statistics and provides a wide range of techniques and libraries for statistical analysis and modeling.
